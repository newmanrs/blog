## Basic test

Someday I'll try to find the time to actually write some real content here.  Mostly testing different blog features.

\\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
```

```
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
```

The good news is it seems to be functioning, so maybe I can get around to writing up a series on some fun, but likely useless mathematics.
