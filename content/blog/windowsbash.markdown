Does windows bash work?

<!--more-->

I've been trying out the windows bash subsystem recently and it actually seems useful for some basic workflows. There are some obnoxious issues with tmux and vim pertaining to the clipboard,  but no worse than those that used to plague OSX (no recent update/comment on that one).  

Matplotlib works with VcXsrv (TODOLINK) so you can do basic plt.show().  I haven't found any notable glitches yet, and it's a bit faster for toying around on the command line than saving pdfs/pngs.  I do note that it probably would be easier to do plotting in Jupyter notebooks, but I still often want to keep it to the command line.  I find it makes my code far better thought out than monkey coding in interactive notebooks where you can be careless or sloppy about organizing data structures.
