Recently a friend of mine said he wanted to live up the suburban dream and waste his garage space on a hobby project that may turn into a side hustle.  This project was home soapmaking.  In preparation for him putting up budget to do this, we have commenced upon reading books on making liquid soap from cooking oils - the old ways.

# Aside classic soapmaking chemistry

Briefly before we get to this books the process of creating soap from lye and oils is known as saponification.

Most cooking oils consist of various triglycides - a chain of three fatty acids connected to a glycerol backbone with ester bonds.  These molecules undergo hydrolysis in the presence of sodium or potassium hydroxide splitting the triglycerides into 3 acid salts and glycerol.  

TODO DIAGRAM.  (By hand?)

TODO - what type of nucleophilic substitution is this.

Most soaps today are a mixture of an industrial surfactant, usually sodium dodecyl sulphate, which most often is labelled with an industrial name of lauryl sulphate, as to sound more flowery.  You know, like nobody wanted to buy Canola oil under it's original name.


# Book #1 - Liquid Soapmaking by Jackie Thompson

todo somewhere cite the book.  todo should I infest my own website with amazon affiliate links.

Firstly, I will say this is a pretty good book (or if the recipes contained in it hold, very good - will hold my thoughts on that matter.

The book contains effectively zero chemistry and provides recipes for mixing based on "SAP" (saponification values) that relate the amount of oil and lye to mix for different oils to compensate for their differing compositions.  

Recipes in this book are provided in two methods - one that forms a paste, and another that remains a liquid.  For reasons of ease of mixing it's not wholly obvious to me when to bother directly making a paste, but perhaps it allows for a thicker final product.  I would rather not heat and mix a paste for hours so it seems that using a recipe for a viscous liquid will be easier.

This book also details what natural oils can or cannot be added due to limits of current regulatory law.

I will also note that for a book with little chemistry, in an area of making home made soap in the classical way from oils rather than using industrial surfactants there seems to be refreshingly little pseudoscience or error (some perhaps dubious remarks about EDTA as a stabilizing agent).  Seems useful, probably should update if the reviews turn out.

# Book #2 - Soap & Cosmetic Labeling by Marie Gale

todo: citation

This book goes over the regulatory burden soaps fall under.  This mostly tedious but the book explains it well.  I think the main madness or interest in this book is the introduction giving the history of the order of potentially relevant regulations and acts of congress.

I won't say that this book is particularly interesting, but there are a few vaguely interesting sections which are important to read if you're planning to package soap for sale.

Firstly, there is a massive set of regulations on product labelling - font sizes used relative to size of package, or whether or not it's an exterior package with an interior package, or has-only-one-package (both exterior and interior applies simultaneously).  The regulatory attention to detail is what creates uniform product labelling in the US, but I hadn't quite realized to the extent even the font sizes are dictated based on product surface area.  

Secondly, for a product of identical chemical composition the regulatory burden increases with the more product claims you make.  That is, for an identical product how you market it determines the regulations you must comply with.  For instance, if you caim the product is just "soap" and make no purposes or claims it will be considered a consumer commodity.  With additional claims, it probably will be considered a cosmetic, but may also be considered a pesticde, drug, or food (although I suspect very few people make edibility claims about their home made natural soap).  This book is a great reminder that from a legal standpoint our laws are intent-based and not chemistry based.
