Repository for my personal website built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is now public incase anyone wants to use it as a template build a similar webpage. I suppose all content within is pretty much available on the live [site](http://richmondnewman.com).  The theme for the site is currently [hugo-imperfect-future-slim](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim).  I've disabled many of the elements to try to keep the appearance cleaner to my tastes, and have added mathjacs support.
