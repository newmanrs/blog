If you wish to customize any of the files in the theme for your personal use, simply create a duplicate file at the project-level instead of the theme level. This is function that is innate to Hugo based on Hugoâ€™s lookup order

For example, if you wanted to change the About Me Page Template (<my-project>/themes/layouts/_default/about.html). You would create a new file at <my-project>/layouts/_default/about.html based on the theme file, but including your modifications

This is the proper way to adjust files for personal use in a way that does not make your site incompatible with the theme.
