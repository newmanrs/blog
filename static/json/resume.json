As a graduate student at the University of Michigan he wrote software to analyze statistical mechanical simulations of nanoparticles in order to study the thermodynamics of self-assembly. His interests are generally broader than this specific work, and he is enthusiastic about applying science and numerical data analysis to solve real-world problems.  At the present he is analyzing data at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance supporting efforts to develop clinical pathways.",
